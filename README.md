# @salesforce/salesforcedx-vscode-test-tools

Test automation framework for Salesforce Extensions for VS Code.

## Introduction

This package provides a comprehensive test automation framework for working with Salesforce Extensions for VS Code. It is extracted from the Salesforce Extensions for VS Code automation tests.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @salesforce/salesforcedx-vscode-test-tools
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { log, setUpScratchOrg, openFolder } from '@salesforce/salesforcedx-vscode-test-tools';

// Use the imported functions directly
log('Hello, world!');
```

### Framework Structure

The framework is organized into the following modules:

- **Core**: Basic types, constants, and common utility functions
- **System Operations**: File system, CLI commands, git operations, and settings
- **Salesforce Components**: Authorization, deployment, Apex, LWC, and Visualforce utilities
- **Testing**: Extension management, test utilities, and predicates
- **UI Interaction**: Command prompts, notifications, editor, terminal, and workbench interactions

## Documentation

### Generating Documentation Locally

To generate the documentation locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate documentation
npm run docs

# Open documentation in your browser
open docs/index.html
```

For real-time updates while editing documentation:

```bash
npm run docs:watch
```

## Development

### Commitizen

This project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for standardized commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

To create a new commit:

```bash
npm run commit
```

This will guide you through an interactive process to create a properly formatted commit message. The commit message format is enforced using husky hooks.

### Scripts

- `npm run compile` - Compile TypeScript code
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run docs` - Generate API documentation
- `npm run docs:watch` - Generate API documentation with watch mode

### RedHat VS Code Extension Tester

This project is based on ExTester, available at https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-extension-tester

### Getting Started

If you are interested in contributing, please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

After cloning this repo, you will also need to have a folder called `salesforcedx-vscode` residing side-by-side in the same parent location, and have the vsixes you want to test in `salesforcedx-vscode/extensions` directory. e.g:

```
.
├── ...
├── salesforcedx-vscode-automation-tests-redhat    # E2E Tests repo
├── salesforcedx-vscode
│   └── extensions                          # Directory containing the salesforce extensions
│       ├── salesforcedx-vscode-core-63.0.0.vsix
│       ├── salesforcedx-vscode-apex-63.0.0.vsix
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

To install the test dependencies, run `npm install`. You do not need to compile - when running the e2e automation tests, the code is dynamically compiled.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the automation tests. These are managed by the `EnvironmentSettings` class.

| Environment Variable        | Description                                                                                           | Default Value                 |

#### Usage Notes

- **SPEC_FILES**: If specified, only the named test spec files will be run instead of all tests

- **TEST_RESOURCES**: Path to the workspace directory where VS Code and test artifacts are stored

- **EXTENSIONS_FOLDER**: Path to the extensions directory where extensions will be installed

- **SFDX_AUTH_URL**: To obtain this URL, run `sf org display -o vscodeOrg --verbose --json` in your terminal and extract the value from the `sfdxAuthUrl` property

- **USE_EXISTING_PROJECT_PATH**: If specified, must point to a valid existing project directory. The test framework will use this project instead of creating a new one

- **THROTTLE_FACTOR**: Useful for debugging tests by slowing down UI interactions. For example, setting to `2` will make tests run at half speed

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Run a specific test file
SPEC_FILES=soql.e2e.js npm test

# Run tests with custom DevHub alias
DEV_HUB_ALIAS_NAME=myDevHub DEV_HUB_USER_NAME=myuser@example.com npm test

# Run tests with slower execution speed (for debugging)
THROTTLE_FACTOR=2 npm test

# Run tests with increased logging
E2E_LOG_LEVEL=debug npm test
```

### Dev Hub

A requirement of this project is for a Dev Hub to have been enabled on the user's machine. The default Dev Hub name is "vscodeOrg" and the default username is "svcideebot@salesforce.com", though this can be configured with the `DEV_HUB_ALIAS_NAME` and `DEV_HUB_USER_NAME` environment variables.
Run Task: `Authorize DevHub - E2E Testing Org` through command palette (Cmd+shift+P).
Once you are connected to the org with `DEV_HUB_ALIAS_NAME` and `DEV_HUB_USER_NAME`, you can run a single or all end-to-end test suites.

### Run the tests

After the dependencies have been installed, the vsixes downloaded and stored in the right folder, and the environment variables have been set, open `salesforcedx-vscode-automation-tests-redhat` repo in Visual Studio Code, then debug using the `Debug Automation Test from env var SPEC_FILES` configuration in RUN AND DEBUG section in the left sidebar.

Note: At this point you should already have authorized `vscodeOrg` which will be used as your target DevHub, so don't forget to comment out `await this.setupAndAuthorizeOrg();` in setup() method from [test-setup-and-runner](test/test-setup-and-runner.ts) so you don't run into errors during setup while running E2E Tests locally.

Note: if no changes are made to `_specFiles` property in [environmentSettings](test/environmentSettings.ts) class, then all tests will be run. If you want to run only some, comment out `'./test/specs/**/*.e2e.ts'` line in that file and uncomment the tests you want to run.

## Test Configuration

This framework allows customizing the test environment through the `TestConfig` interface. You can specify the following options:

### Test Resources

By default, the framework creates a test resources folder in your project directory to store VS Code and test artifacts. You can customize this location through:

1. Environment variable: `TEST_RESOURCES`
2. Programmatically through the `TestConfig` interface

Example configuration through environment variables:

```bash
TEST_RESOURCES=/tmp/my-test-workspace npm test
```

Example programmatic usage:

```typescript
import { TestSetupAndRunner, TestConfig } from '@salesforce/salesforcedx-vscode-test-tools';

const testConfig: Partial<TestConfig> = {
  testResources: '/tmp/my-test-workspace'
};

const testRunner = new TestSetupAndRunner(testConfig);
await testRunner.setup();
const result = await testRunner.runTests();
```

### Extensions Path

By default, extensions are installed in the `extensions` subfolder of the workspace path. You can override this with:

1. Environment variable: `EXTENSIONS_FOLDER`
2. Programmatically through the `TestConfig` interface

If only `testResources` is specified, the `extensionsFolder` will automatically be set to `${testResources}/extensions`.

### VSIX Installation Directory

You can specify a dedicated directory containing VSIX files to be installed during test setup. This separates the source of VSIX files from the extensions folder where they get installed.

This can be configured through:

1. Environment variable: `VSIX_TO_INSTALL`
2. Programmatically through the `TestConfig` interface

```bash
# Set a custom VSIX installation directory
VSIX_TO_INSTALL=/path/to/vsix-directory npm test
```

Example programmatic usage:

```typescript
import { TestSetupAndRunner, TestConfig } from '@salesforce/salesforcedx-vscode-test-tools';

const testConfig: Partial<TestConfig> = {
  vsixToInstallDir: '/path/to/vsix-directory'
};

const testRunner = new TestSetupAndRunner(testConfig);
await testRunner.setup();
const result = await testRunner.runTests();
```

If both the `TestConfig` and environment variable are set, the `TestConfig` value takes precedence.
